MapReduce
=========

Sample code of MapReduce talk for JUG Milano, available at https://www.slideshare.net/andreaiacono/mapreduce-by-examples

It contains the code for:
* a basic [WordCount](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/wordcount) example 
* finding the [top-n used words in a text file with combiner](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/topn)
* finding the [top-n used words in a text file with optimization](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/topn_enhanced)
* [Computing the mean](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/mean) of a set of numbers
* [Executing a join](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/join) between two data files
* executing [K-means](https://github.com/andreaiacono/MapReduce/tree/master/src/main/java/samples/kmeans) clustering on a dataset
